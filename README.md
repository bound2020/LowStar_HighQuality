# LowStar_HighQuality

There are huge amounts of repos on Github. People tend to look for high star repos, which are most likely to be high quality. However, the long-tail law also applies to Github, meaning there exist many low star but high code quality repos.

I've collected the so called low-star-high-quality repos list. So far all of them are about **Deep Learning and CTR algorithms**.

The list is still growing now, and if you like to name some of your findings, any recommendation of any technology is welcome.

The current definition of 

- low star: **<= 50 stars**
- high quality: the code is readable, runnable and highly-efficient is most appreciate
